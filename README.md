# Remix Project

**Remix Project** is a platform for development tools that use a plugin architecture. It encompasses sub-projects including Remix Plugin Engine, Remix Libraries, and of course Remix IDE.

Remix is used for the **entire journey of contract development with [Solidity language](https://soliditylang.org/)** in as well as being a playground for learning and teaching Ethereum.
